\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-author, Alejandro Aceves, I would like to submit the article ``Multi-pulse solitary waves in a fourth-order nonlinear {S}chr{\"o}dinger equation'' for consideration of publication in Physica D. In this work, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of multi-pulse solutions in a nonlinear {S}chr{\"o}dinger equation with both fourth and second-order dispersion terms. In particular, we look at the case of pure fourth-order dispersion, which is of recent interest to experimentalists studying optical waveguides. This paper has not been submitted elsewhere.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
